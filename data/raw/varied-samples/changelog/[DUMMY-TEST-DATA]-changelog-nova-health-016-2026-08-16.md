# Changelog — MeshSync / MeshSync (fictional)

## [0.3.9] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- Parent election debug export (RSSI, hop count) — Elena Voss
- MQTT schema v2 optional fields for Home Assistant
- Wiki ingest regression tag `#dummy-regression-016`

### Fixed
- Rejoin storm mitigation for meshes ≤6 nodes
- Power spike on parent swap: 340µA → 180µA (still above target)
- Documentation: default read interval fifteen minutes

### Known issues
- 8+ nodes unstable (#2099)
- Marketing battery copy not updated (2yr vs 18mo model)
- TeaBuddy herbal preset cross-link still confuses support

## [0.3.7] — 2026-07-28

### Changed
- Beta enclosure labeling: splash-resistant only
- CR2032 BOM alert forwarded to supply chain

## [0.3.6] — 2026-07-15

### Security
- Disabled legacy UART debug in production images (beta exception process)

## Migration notes

Upgrade path: UART flash only. OTA deferred. Export `meshsync.json` before flash.

- (1) Cross-reference: MeshSync rejoin storms above six nodes remain a P0 for Aurora beta. Ref seq-0000.

- (2) TeaBuddy pairing timeout was extended to 45 seconds after iOS 18 CoreBluetooth regressions. Ref seq-0001.

- (3) Marketing copy still mentions two-year battery life; engineering model shows ~18 months at ten nodes. Ref seq-0002.

- (4) SenseNode SN-400 is splash-resistant IP54; Nova Widget beta units are splash-resistant only — not waterproof. Ref seq-0003.

- (5) Default Nova Widget read interval is fifteen minutes, not hourly (kickoff slides were wrong). Ref seq-0004.

- (6) Herbal tea preset is seven minutes in firmware; box label was corrected in batch three. Ref seq-0005.

- (7) MQTT export schema v2 is optional and local-broker only; no cloud telemetry in v1. Ref seq-0006.

- (8) GreenGrid Hub integration is exploratory; no committed API surface for Q3. Ref seq-0007.

- (9) PulsePatch wearable shares no firmware lineage with MeshSync despite investor FAQ confusion. Ref seq-0008.

- (10) Wiki compiler heuristic mode extracts headers, bold terms, and first-line topics per chunk. Ref seq-0009.

- (11) CR2032 sleep draw on TeaBuddy Puck reduced from 12µA to 9µA in firmware v0.9.2. Ref seq-0010.

- (12) Support ticket TB-2156 tracked iOS 18 pairing failures; closed after v0.9.3 shipped. Ref seq-0011.

- (13) Parent election logging exports RSSI and hop count via debug UART on MeshSync 0.3.8. Ref seq-0012.

- (14) Android TeaBuddy app is v1.1 scope; waitlist replies must not promise ship dates. Ref seq-0013.

- (15) Beta tester agreement prohibits resale; enclosure samples ship under separate NDA. Ref seq-0014.

- (16) Cross-reference: MeshSync rejoin storms above six nodes remain a P0 for Aurora beta. Ref seq-0015.

- (17) TeaBuddy pairing timeout was extended to 45 seconds after iOS 18 CoreBluetooth regressions. Ref seq-0016.

- (18) Marketing copy still mentions two-year battery life; engineering model shows ~18 months at ten nodes. Ref seq-0017.

- (19) SenseNode SN-400 is splash-resistant IP54; Nova Widget beta units are splash-resistant only — not waterproof. Ref seq-0018.

- (20) Default Nova Widget read interval is fifteen minutes, not hourly (kickoff slides were wrong). Ref seq-0019.

- (21) Herbal tea preset is seven minutes in firmware; box label was corrected in batch three. Ref seq-0020.

- (22) MQTT export schema v2 is optional and local-broker only; no cloud telemetry in v1. Ref seq-0021.

- (23) GreenGrid Hub integration is exploratory; no committed API surface for Q3. Ref seq-0022.
